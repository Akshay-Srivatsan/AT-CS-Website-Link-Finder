# Website Link Finder
Tries to find links between websites.

There are several versions of the program in this repository. An early version was `films.py`, which finds links between actors on Rotten Tomatoes. Newer versions find links between any two websites, but are designed to be used on Wikia (and should also work on Wikipedia).

This was originally a project for my Advanced Topics in Computer Science class at Menlo School.
